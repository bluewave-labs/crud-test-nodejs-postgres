## Practices and patterns

- [Unit testing: Link 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing), [Link 2](https://www.testim.io/blog/node-js-unit-testing-get-started-quickly-with-examples/), [Link 3](https://www.lambdatest.com/learning-hub/nodejs-unit-testing)
- Clean git commits that show your work progress.

## Help

- Use postgreSQL as database
- Each User can have multiple tasks
- When a User is deleted, its related tasks must be deleted as well

---

## Validations

- During Create; validate all the fields (You can use Google's **LibPhoneNumber** to validate mobile number).
- Users must be **unique** in the database: By **firstname, lastname, dateOfBirth, and phone**.
